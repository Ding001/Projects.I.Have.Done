# Projects.I.Have.Done
A repository with original code of some of my projeccts ranging from University projects to home projects. I don't usually include good documentation in my code so they can be a bit harder to understand. 
## The University of Sydney
### INFO1003 - Foundations of Information Technology

I took this subject in my freshmen year as an optional unit of study as I always wanted to know how websites are made (*unlike by using web apps like wix.com or wordpress*) and the underlying technicalities that ensue. It focused on Web development using `HTMl`,`CSS`, `JavaScript` and also looked at data management systems along with data forcasting using *Excel*. It was a great learning experience overall.        

__The Project__  
Make a website that is used to educate people on their happiness through an index/philosophy called [__*Gross National Happiness*__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness), a term coined by the late King of Bhutan [Jigme Singye Wangchuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigme_Singye_Wangchuck), to measure the collective happiness in any specific nation. This was a *Group Project* with my team-mates' information being in the [`contact.html`](https://github.com/syedumar97/Projects.I.Have.Done/blob/master/contact.html) file. A lot of the code was done by me including the visualization of the site and the content that needs to be put on.  

__Languages Used__  

 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
 * PHP
 * jQuery (a JavaScript Library) 
 * PostgreSQL (for the database)
 
__Salient Features__

 * A jQuery-driven World map indicating Happiness index of countries. *(Using a data map with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/))*
 * A happiness quiz.
 * User accounts.
 * AJAX.
 * Server-side database (Using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin).  
 ***Note:*** The server was provided by Faculty of Engineering and IT, The University of Sydney. Also, parts of the project are incomplete(especially color coding the map).
